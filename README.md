# Android-Malware-Detection

Mobile malware is malicious software that attacks mobile phones or wireless-enabled Personal digital assistants (PDAs), causing the system to crash and confidential data to be lost or leaked. As cellular phones and PDA networks have grown in popularity and complexity, ensuring their safety and security against electronic threats such as viruses and other malware has become increasingly difficult.<br>
Data science has become an attractive subject in cybersecurity because analytical models based on data allow for the discovery of insights that might assist forecast dangerous activities. In this project, I will be training a model using neural network in order to detect android malware. I will be utilizing open datasets to evaluate specific network layer features as the foundation for machine learning models that can detect android malware.<br>

## Overview
* Dataset is a csv file consisting of information about the android devices that was created from the feature extraction process with DREBIN and Malgenome project malware samples. 
* Feature vectors for 215 attributes were retrieved from 15,036 applications in this dataset (5,560 malware apps from Drebin project and 9,476 benign apps).
* Used Artificial neural network to train the model
* 5 epochs, RMSprop as optimizer and binary cross entropy as loss function
* The main goal is to detect if there is presence of malware by using the attributes extracted from Android applications as features. 
* So, whenever we have new dataset with all the attributes needed, we can clearly detect malware and prevent unauthorized access to privacy sensitive informations. <br>

#### Tools and libraries used
* Colab
* Python 3.7
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* sklearn
* Keras
* Tensorflow

#### Requirements
Codes are written in python and requires python 3.6 + to run.

## Kears and neural network
Keras is a free open source Python framework for constructing and evaluating deep learning models that is both powerful and simple to use. It covers Theano and TensorFlow, two efficient numerical computation frameworks, and allows you to create and train neural network models with just a few lines of code.
