# Android-Malware-Detection

Mobile malware is malicious software that attacks mobile phones or wireless-enabled Personal digital assistants (PDAs), causing the system to crash and confidential data to be lost or leaked. As cellular phones and PDA networks have grown in popularity and complexity, ensuring their safety and security against electronic threats such as viruses and other malware has become increasingly difficult.<br>

* Keras
* Tensorflow

#### Requirements
Codes are written in python and requires python 3.6 + to run.

## Kears and neural network
Keras is a free open source Python framework for constructing and evaluating deep learning models that is both powerful and simple to use. It covers Theano and TensorFlow, two efficient numerical computation frameworks, and allows you to create and train neural network models with just a few lines of code.
